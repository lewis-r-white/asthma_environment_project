# Environmental Factors in Asthma Hospitalizations 

Globally, asthma affected roughly 262 million people and caused over 450,000 deaths in 2019. Here in the United States, 25 million Americans have asthma and over 4,000 die from it each year. It's important to note that asthma does not effect all groups equally: the disease is more common among women, individuals living in poverty, and Black and indigenous people. From my own experience with asthma, I've noticed that exposure to poor air quality really makes a noticeable difference in my breathing. The effect is particulalry pronounced when the poor air quality is due to smoke from fires.  

For our final project in Environmental Statistics, I wanted to explore how various factors (e.g. air quality and smoke from wildfire) were related to hospitalizations due to asthma. 

For my project, I use data from a number of sources: The EPA, California Health and Human Services (CHHS) Open Data Portal, California Open Data Portal, the US Census Bureau, and the Environmental Change and Human Outcomes (ECHO) lab at Stanford. Using this data, I conducted multiple regression analysis and a Welch t-test. 

The repository contains three files, an R-Markdown where I confucted my initial analysis, and two R scripts that I used to create a [blog post](https://lewis-r-white.github.io/posts/2022-12-03-asthma-blog/) for my website.
